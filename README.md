# Raspberry Pi-Based Smart Reader for Blind Individuals



## 📌 Overview
The Raspberry Pi-Based Smart Reader is an assistive technology designed for visually impaired individuals, enabling them to access printed text through real-time speech output. The system uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from images captured by a camera and converts it into speech using Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology. With a user-friendly interface, local and cloud storage options, and multilingual support, this cost-effective and portable device enhances accessibility and independence for blind users.
## ⚙️ Features

✅ Text Recognition – Uses Tesseract OCR to extract text from images.

✅ Text-to-Speech Conversion – Converts recognized text into speech using eSpeak or Google TTS.

✅ User-Friendly Interface – Simple button-based control for ease of use.

✅ Real-Time Notifications – Option to send extracted text to an IoT platform for remote access.

✅ Local & Cloud Storage – Saves extracted text locally and can upload to cloud storage.

✅ Low Power Mode – Optimized for energy efficiency.

✅ Customizable Language Support – Supports multiple languages for accessibility.

✅ Multi-Device Support – Can be expanded for integration with other smart devices.
